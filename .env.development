# Development Environment Configuration
# Feature flags for progressive rollout of optimizations

# Sprint 1: Progressive Scene Loading V1 (deprecated)
# Set to 'true' to enable, 'false' to disable
VITE_PROGRESSIVE_LOADING=false

# Sprint 2: Progressive Scene Loading V2 - BROKEN, DO NOT USE
# Breaks tree structure - produces flat list instead of hierarchy
VITE_PROGRESSIVE_LOADING_V2=false

# Sprint 3: Progressive Scene Loading V3 (correct tree structure)
# Uses identical logic to SceneService with progressive events
# - Correct parent-child hierarchy (same as sync)
# - Events emitted as nodes load for UI updates
# - Yields to browser for responsive UI
VITE_PROGRESSIVE_LOADING_V3=true

# Lazy attrInfo Loading (works with V1, V2, V3)
# Only loads attribute info when node is selected
VITE_LAZY_ATTR_INFO=true
